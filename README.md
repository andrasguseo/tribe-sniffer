## How to use it
This tool is meant to be used as a bookmarklet.

### Quick deploy

1. Copy the one-line script from `tribe-sniffer.min.js` to your clipboard.
2. In your preferred browser create a new bookmark button on the bookmark bar.
3. Name it "Tribe Sniffer" or whatever you like.
4. Paste the code into the location / URL field and save it.
5. When visiting a webpage click on the bookmark button. A popup dialog will contain the information.

### Slow deploy

The non-minified file is a TamperMonkey script. It will run on the websites defined with `@match`.
Also, the dialog box will pop up on every pageload, which can be annoying. :)

To use it as a bookmarklet you will need to minimize the script. You can use an online tool like https://javascript-minifier.com/

Here are the steps to create a bookmarklet from the code:

1. Take the code without the header (starting with `(function`) and run it through the minifier.
2. Change the beginning from `!function()` to `javascript:(function()`. (Delete `!` and add `javacript:(`.)
3. Change the end from `}();` to `})();`. (Add a closing parentheses `)` after the curly bracket `}`.)
4. Select the minified code and copy it on your clipboard.
5. In your preferred browser create a new bookmark button on the bookmark bar.
6. Name it "Tribe Sniffer" or whatever you like.
7. Paste the code into the location / URL field and save it.
8. When visiting a webpage click on the bookmark button. A popup dialog will contain the information.
